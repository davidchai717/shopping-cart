# Shopping Cart

Database-less shopping cart, built on top of React and Express (with some help from local storage)

## Getting started

1. _npm install_ to install all dependencies
2. _npm start_ to build the application and initiate the Express server (accessed via localhost:3000)

In addition, _npm run dev_ executes a dev environment with hot loading available, and _npm test_ starts the test script.
